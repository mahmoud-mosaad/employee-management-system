## üîê Security Credentials

The API is secured using HTTP Basic Authentication. Use the following credentials to test the endpoints.

| Username | Password   | Role  |
|----------|------------|-------|
| `admin`  | `admin123` | ADMIN |
| `user`   | `user123`  | USER  |

## üìä Database Design (ERD)

The database schema is included in the repository. The ERD visually represents the **one-to-many** relationship between Departments and Employees.

* **Location**: `docs/erd.jpg`

---

## üß™ API Testing (Postman)

A Postman collection is provided to test all API endpoints. It includes pre-configured requests for both `ADMIN` and `USER` roles to demonstrate the security rules.

* **Location**: `docs/postman_collection.json`

## üèõÔ∏è Key Design Patterns

This project uses several key design patterns to ensure the code is clean, maintainable, and scalable.

* **API Contract Interface**: The API is defined in a Java `interface`, creating a clean separation between the public contract and its internal implementation.

* **Standardized Response Envelope**: All API responses use a consistent wrapper (`ApiResponseDTO`). This makes the API predictable and simplifies client-side handling, especially for pagination.

* **Abstract Base Controller**: An `AbstractController` centralizes response-building logic, keeping the endpoint implementations clean and free of boilerplate code.

* **Service Abstraction**: Services are defined by `interfaces` to decouple the web layer from the business logic, which improves testability and flexibility.
